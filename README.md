# Final Project

You are now working at your first development shop for a local digital marketing/development agency. Your company has been tasked in creating an eCommerce site for a small local business.

Your coworker, Joe Designer, has already created a design for the website and has provided a 3 page basic template for you to build:
 - Home page
 - Products List Page
 - Single Product Page

You must:
1. Pick a company
2. Develop each page layout
    - Make sure the layout is responsive and works with mobile designs that Joe has provided.
    - Each screen should have two designs, one for a desktop user and the other for a mobile user.
3. Style the layout with fonts and colors and text of your choosing.
4. Pick 24 products that the company will sell, and this should be paginated over 3 pages
5. Include a photo for each product.
6. Add all products to the page using javascript, your products cannot be hardcoded to the page, they must be added dynamically using javascript. If you do not use javascript to add the products to the page, points will be deducted.
7. Display all of the products on products list page. Each product should be linked to its product page.
